# Internship Web Scraper
Because searching for new postings is a chore.

I wrote more out this in a [blog post](https://2018kguo.medium.com/a-web-scraper-for-internships-880861a05f58) 

To run, edit the configuation within config.yaml, install dependencies in requirements.txt, and run main.py
Currently, the found internship listings are outputted to the output/ folder. This can be edited within main.py

TODO: Set up a way to alert when new internships are released
